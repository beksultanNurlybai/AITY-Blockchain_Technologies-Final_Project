Overview
The purpose of this project is to build a web-based blockchain application that demonstrates the fundamentals of blockchain technology and how it can be applied in real-world scenarios. The project is designed to serve as a foundation for further exploration into blockchain applications, including smart contracts, decentralized ledgers, and more.

Features
Blockchain Integration: Built-in blockchain functionality using Solidity smart contracts.
User Authentication: A basic user authentication system.
Data Management: Interacts with a blockchain to store and retrieve data.
UI with EJS Templates: Renders web pages dynamically with EJS templates.
Server Side Processing: Backend API to handle requests and interact with the blockchain.
Technologies Used
EJS for dynamic HTML templates (39.3%)
JavaScript for front-end functionality (37.9%)
Python for server-side logic and API handling (14.0%)
Solidity for smart contract development (7.4%)
CSS for styling (1.4%)
Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/beksultanNurlybai/AITY-Blockchain_Technologies-Final_Project.git
cd AITY-Blockchain_Technologies-Final_Project
Install dependencies:

Run npm install for JavaScript and front-end dependencies.
Use pip install -r requirements.txt for Python dependencies if required.
Compile Smart Contracts:

Navigate to the solidity folder and compile the Solidity smart contracts.
Run the Server:

Start the server by running node server.js or use python app.py depending on the server setup.
Usage
Start the application by running the appropriate server command.
Access the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
Interact with the blockchain functionalities through the web interface.
